          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hello there! I'm <b>Gerald Miguel B. Mombay</b>. People call me <b>Migz</b>, <b>Miggy</b>, but never Gerald. I’m currently in my 2nd year of college taking up BS Computer Science at the University of the Philippines - Los Baños. I chose this degree program because growing up I’ve been in love with computers. It always piqued my interest whenever I saw one. It always made me wonder how it worked on the inside, how it could show images on the display. Plus, looking at circuit boards back then made me think that they were the coolest things in the world.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Today, computers still interest me. However, it’s not quite like it was before. I don’t want to know how they work anymore. Rather, I want to see what can still be created from these amazing machines. I want to know how I can apply different algorithms to create various programs. I want to know if there are more efficient ways to handle large amounts of data. I want to make an AI that can manage my investments and so much more. The possibilities are endless and that’s what I love about this field of study. Reading all of this, I hope that you can get an image in your mind about what kind of person I am. If not, then the following content might help you more.</p>

              <h2>Ethics 1</h2>
              <p> I’ve always liked Philosophy as a subject and as a result of that I enjoyed my time learning about ethics. I think that taking ethics and thoroughly understanding it is also necessary in computer science especially in creating programs. Especially today, where your data is also a part of who you are.

              <h2>CMSC 100</h2>
              <p> I’ve been really interested in web-design ever since I was in elementary school. I tried competing back in high school but I didn’t have the understanding that I have now. That’s why I’m really looking forward to this course as I wish to further my understanding of the concepts in web development.

            <img src="img/prog-lang-2.png" alt="favorite programming language">
            <p>As far as programming languages go, I've learned to love <b>C</b> the most. It’s not my “favorite” in the sense that I can never deviate from it. Rather, it’s the one I’m most comfortable using. Yes, there are many programming languages that are easier to deal with compared to C. However, I feel like this language gives me the most control over what I can work with and do. At the same time, programming using this language gives me more of an insight into how the computer works on a machine level. Although assembly is closer to that level, I’m not that well versed in it yet. That’s why my favorite programming language is quite fickle.

            <h1>Food</h1>
            <p>I love cooking and I love eating good food. Thus, I have quite the number of favorites. However, only one kind of food comes into mind when I’m feeling depressed, overjoyed, or even angry. It’s Lasagna. The first time I encountered this dish was from watching garfield. At the time, I’ve never heard of or tasted that dish since my parents never made it at home. So when we got to a restaurant that served it, I ordered one. Since then, it has served a special place in my heart or should I say in my stomach.
